    <h1>Designing for an International Audience</h1>
    <h2>How does the user experience depend on culture, and how do we design for international users?</h2>
  </header>

  <p>In the last blog, we discussed some ways that website layout differs based on culture and language. But why do these differences occur, especially because it might seem intuitive that those on the world wide web would have the same standard for what makes a good website? China and South Korea are often categorized as countries with high-context cultures, meaning that they are more open to communicating with high levels of inference; America, on the other hand, is often said to have a low-context culture, meaning that people generally say what they mean, and seek straightforward communication. It seems that popular web designs reflect these cultural preferences, with sites in the US often featuring clean, monochromatic, and often slightly minimalist open-concept sites, and Asian sites featuring large blocks of information that lead the user to have to investigate links or make inferences or search around to find what they’re looking for. Generally, it seems that low-context cultures prefer more neutral color palettes, while more complex graphics and bright colors accompany the high-context cultures. This translates to the packed layout as well, where low-context cultures want ease of use, and the packed layout of high-context sites ensures getting the most amount of information/meaning per page and a full use of the available space. </p>

  <p>Web and user interface designers, given this information, must always consider ways to make their sites more internationally friendly, as well as be aware of their target audiences. One way designers have handled layout differences for large companies is by making multiple pages under the same general style tile that cater to different cultures (i.e. making navigation or search easy in different languages). Making an effort to make your site multilingual is another way to ensure that users come back. Furthermore, no matter if you’re designing for a culture where people read right to left instead of left to right (i.e. Japanese, Arabic cultures),  as long as the most relevant or important information hooks readers at the top of the page, it’s likely that your user will continue to read through the page. Although the way people around the world use websites may seem very different, we all simply desire to find the information we’re looking for, and feel connected. Keeping global usability as well as detail in mind when planning a website’s layout and features can make your site the best it can be. </p>
